- Week 1: Basic Loadsmart trainings.
- Week 2: Basic Engineering trainings.
- Week 3 to 6 or 8: Continuous improvements, bug fixes and small projects.
- After that: Default engineering projects.

The suggestion is not to put someone in default “dangerous” projects right away so that they can learn in a more controlled environment.
