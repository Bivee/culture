- Always design the architecture of a new system on the tech spec.
- The best way to communicate an architecture is with a drawing.
- Just propose a new architecture if we have a clear reason on why to do it. Let's not increase the entropy without reason.
- Promote architectures that are loosely coupled and highly cohesive.
- Hide implementation details behind well designed interfaces. Use APIs to connect different systems.
- Don't build too big systems with too wide responsibilities.
