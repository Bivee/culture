## Implementation Tasks

### Task Breakdown 

Break down the work into smaller and meaningful tasks.
It helps us get started,
and know when we are really done.

### Task Description

Write a description for each task / sub-task.
Explain the problem and define the scope of the solution.
It helps teammates understand what is to be worked on.

### Task Appetite

Determine the appetite for each task.
Make sure it is clear how long the task will take,
and reduce the scope if time-boxing is necessary.

### Acceptance Criteria

Define acceptance criteria for each task.
They are single statements that must be testable
once the task is complete.

### Task Update

Update often the status of tasks / sub-tasks
in order to be accountable to teammates and other stakeholders.
