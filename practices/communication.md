# Communication

## Async Communication

At Loadsmart, the engineering team works 100% remotely. We believe async communication is key for our day-to-day work.

### Business Time Visibility

People are working from different time zones, and we need to be aware of and respect it. For example, if we don't know your timezone or your working hours, we don't know when you would be able to attend a meeting or answer a message. Two tips here:
You can set your working hours using Google Calendar. With that, everybody will see it when scheduling a meeting with you.
Add this information to your Slack profile. It will be available with a single click on your Slack picture. We recommend this format `<job title> @ <squad/team/department> - Working hours: X AM - Y PM (<timezone>)`

### No Hello

Sometimes, when sending a message via Slack, we may think it is polite to not jump right into the request. However, this is not a good practice and it costs time. The [No Hello](https://nohello.net) website presents a better way to do it, like the following example:
<div align="center">
  <img alt="No Hello" src="./no-hello.png" width="600" />
  <br/>
  <i>Image by <a href="https://nohello.net">No Hello</a></i>
</div>

### Slack Notifications

It is common to have Slack installed on our phones. But that comes with notifications too. Notifications are useful while you are working, but they are certainly unhealthy when you get bombarded by them outside of working hours. It prevents you from disconnecting and resting. Within time, it may increase your level of stress. That's why we recommend configuring Slack to send mobile notifications during your business hours only or for messages sent in urgent channels.


### Slack Status

Slack is our main communication tool. It's through there that people will reach out to you when they need to ask or tell you something. It's crucial to make it clear when you are available and when you are not. For that, we use Slack Status. Some examples are: 

- ‚õî `Out of Office`
- üìÜ `In a Meeting`
- üå©Ô∏è `Unstable Internet Connection`
- etc

Tip: configuring the integration between Google Calendar and Slack will also update your status automatically whenever you are in a meeting.

### Slack Threads

Threads can be used to organize discussions in Slack. Multiple subjects can flood channels with messages. With threads, reply messages can be tied to their original message keeping readers notified with every new message and without distracting others in the channel that might not have an interest in that particular subject. 

### Collaborative Docs

We have many meetings to discuss ideas or proposals. Instead of scheduling a meeting whenever a new project or problem arises, try writing about it in a Google Doc, so the team can use the comments features to have an async discussion. This way, we give people time to understand and evaluate the subject, and they can make a decision without trying to fit everyone in a call at the same time. This feature is also available in other tools like Notion.


### Debugging urgent issues a.k.a. "How to Solve a Fire"

There are fires of different sizes. Yet there's always lessons to be learned. This learning should always be shared with the team so that we save time in the future. Whenever you solve one of those difficult fires, try to cover that case with a regression test. We also recommend doing a write up on how to fix it, if applicable. The next firefighters will thank you for that.


### Meetings Outcome

With the company getting bigger and bigger, it's more likely that people won't be able to attend all the meetings they are invited to. Because of that, it's recommended to either record and/or take notes and to share them after the meeting. Those who could not make it can get up to date afterward. Even for recorded meetings, it is a good idea to summarize it into notes so that people can save time by not having to watch the entire recording.

And when creating a meeting, please make use of the Meetings Notes section of the invite to clearly describe what's it for.


### Emails

Urgent communications should not happen via email. With that being said, people should also not expect that others read their emails as soon as they hit their inboxes. The recommendation is to set a time in your calendar - once or twice a day - to read emails. Make it a routine.


### Block time in your Calendar

Organize your calendar by blocking some time for lunch and other regular breaks you may need. Also, block it when you are Out-of-office. This will prevent you from receiving invitations for meetings that you cannot attend. 

On the other hand, company-wide meetings (Monthly, Town Hall, etc) may still be scheduled and conflict with your blocked slots. In those cases, do your best to attend those as important communication happens there.

At the end, it is up to you to organize your time according to your priorities, both personal and at the company.
