# Onboarding

Welcome to Loadsmart ðŸŽ‰

We're happy to have you here with us. After going through the whole hiring process, you might be wondering now: what comes next?

## The coming weeks

### Week 1

The first week is when you will slowly get to know the company, what we do, how the different areas interact with each other and so on. Logistics is an industry that many of us have no past experience and it takes time to get comfortable with all of the terms. You will go through a general Loadsmart training while also being introduced to the rest of the team you will be working with.

By the end of the first week you should have:
- A better understanding of the problem Loadsmart is solving
- A rough idea of what each of the departments in the company do
- Been introduced to your team and will know their names and background
- Have your computer setup with the general services the company uses (email, Slack, Reflektive, etc.)
- Many, many questions. But don't worry. Take notes and they will be answered with time

### Week 2

In your second week at the company as an engineer, you will be going through the Engineering-specific onboarding. Now that you understand a bit better what the company does and what the problem is, it's time to talk about the solutions and how our Engineering teams are configured to work on them.

By the end of the second week you should have:
- A better understanding on how the Platform Engineering and Product Engineering squads are organized and what's their mission
- An idea of what tech stack each one of them use
- Some sense of how your work interacts with some of the other squads
- The initial setup (projects, credentials, keys, etc.) to start collaborating with some of the projects your team touches


### Week 3 to 6 or 8

After the two initial onboarding weeks, now it's time to be closer to the team. By now, you should be attending their regular meetings, participating in their agile ceremonies, and have a better sense on who's who when you need to talk to someone.

If you are like the majority of the other new members, by the third week you should be hungry to start coding, I bet. You're now more comfortable with the company and team. Now is the time you start being comfortable with the code base. And of course it also takes time. To make your initial experience with us smoother, it is recommended that from the third to the sixth (or eighth week, depending on the team), your contributions are limited to small tasks such as those tech debts that sit at the end of the backlog, or that not-very-urgent bugfix, or even a small feature that would not block the rest of the team from progressing.

Take this time to learn and to feel comfortable with the industry and the projects. Many of the thing you're going to see in the code base are new to you ("What the heck is a BOL? ðŸ¤”"). Don't rush. And ask many questions.

### After that

Great! Now you are at a point that you do feel comfortable with the code base, your team, and the problems they are trying to solve. Amazing! Keep up the good work you have been doing and increasingly start getting bigger and more challenging tasks.
