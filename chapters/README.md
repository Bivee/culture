# Chapters at Loadsmart

At Loadsmart, our commitment to delivering robust, secure, and cutting-edge technology involves not just building new features but also ensuring the reliability, security, and efficiency of our existing systems. To streamline this effort, we've introduced the concept of **Chapters**.

## What are Chapters?

Chapters are specialized, cross-team groups dedicated to maintaining and enhancing specific aspects of our technology ecosystem. Rather than focusing solely on feature development, Chapters concentrate on crucial tasks such as improving CI/CD processes, applying security updates, defining and upholding standards within their respective domains, and configuring essential settings.

## How Chapters Operate:

- **Asynchronous Mode:** Meetings are important, but our goal for chapters is to prioritize asynchronous collaboration whenever feasible and have ad-hoc meetings only when essential. With tools like Jira, Github, and Slack at our disposal, weekly meetings are not necessary.

- **Manage Your Time:** We suggest allocating four hours per week, perhaps on a Friday afternoon, for chapter-related tasks. However, it's at your discretion to balance these responsibilities with your squad duties. If you need assistance in managing this, both the chapter leader and your manager are available to support you.

- **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Members within Chapters come from various teams, fostering cross-pollination of ideas, expertise, and perspectives.

- **Focused Improvement:** Chapters focus on continual enhancement and maintenance within their domain, dedicated to driving excellence in specific areas of our technology stack.

## Why Chapters Matter:

Chapters play a pivotal role in maintaining the health and reliability of our systems. By focusing on core aspects of our technology, they enable our teams to innovate confidently, knowing that the underlying base is stable, secure, and well-maintained.
