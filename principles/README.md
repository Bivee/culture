# Principles

## What is a Principle?

> "A generalization that is accepted as true,
>  and that may be used as a basis for reasoning or conduct."

In other words (now from [ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics)),
a principle is a very general rule
that one can use when deciding how to act
in order to pursue some goal.

A principle is what initiates some action,
while the action is executed
to achieve or maintain some value, 
which is the end goal.
Thus, 
a principle is the beginning,
actions (practices) are the means,
a value is the end.

## Principles of Accountability

### Tracking

Constantly assess whether one is stuck or making progress.

### Responsibility

Unblock oneself; one has options.

### Communication

Ensure stakeholders are aware of setbacks and progress.

### Expectations

Be aware of the expectations of stakeholders about scope and time.
Assess whether they can be achieved. 
Adjust expectations with stakeholders as needed.

## Principles of Productivity

### Assumptions

Before getting started on any activity,
clarify and validate your assumptions,
and the assumptions of the stakeholders.

### Appetite

Assess whether one is trying to do too much at once.
If so, divide work into milestones
in order to conquer the results incrementally. 

### Time-Box 

Assess how long some activity should take. 
Revisit its worthiness if taking too long.
Limit time allocated to activity
by reducing its scope.

### Progress

Ask for help when stuck.
Look for other solutions.
Change goals or compromise
if needed to unblock oneself.

### Value-Oriented

Assess whether the current task
is the most valuable action
one should be executing right now.

### Alignment

Assess whether one is working on planned tasks, and if not,
whether the task will contribute to delivering a release.

## Principles of Quality

### Requirements

Make sure the acceptance tests have been defined
before getting started on any implementation.

### Planning

Analyse the problem.
Understand architecture and design constraints of the solution.
Find the critical path of implementation tasks.

### Maintainability

Encapsulate the components that change often.
Define clear, stable interfaces between the components.
Remember that the team that writes the code needs to maintain it later.

### Scope

Look into scope-cutting
if that will help us maintain quality and schedule.

### Step-By-Step

Break down work into small, easy-to-implement steps.
Each tested step should build on top of the previous ones,
allowing continuous progress.

### Testing

Start testing; finish testing.
Test-drive your implementation whenever possible.
Consider the code "done" only
after all acceptance tests are passing on all environments.

### Everything DRY

Don't repeat yourself ([DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)) 
when writing code or documentation, or even when designing the software.

### SOLID Principles

Use the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles as a guide
when designing and implementing software.
